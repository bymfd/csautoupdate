# muhal
muhal = impossible to happen;
I named it because a software company said it was not possible ***:D***

muhal is a small and efficient system that automatically downloads files from the server if it is different by comparing the mutated server version with the local version. 




# installation:
* <code>git clone https://github.com/bymfd/muhal.git </code>
* <code> cd muhal </code>
* <code>pip install -r req.txt </code>
* <code>auto-py-to-exe </code>
